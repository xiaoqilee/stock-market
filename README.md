## Project Description
Our stock price analyzer will allow users to retrieve data on a stock of interest. For access to market data, we will be using Yahoo Finance’s API. Users will be able to view the data within a specified time range (1 Day, 5 Days, 1 Month, 1 Year) and see statistics on the stock’s average price, highs and lows, and overall trends. A visual representation of the stock trends will be shown using a line graph. Furthermore, users will be able to compare their stock of interest to another stock that they are interested in.
